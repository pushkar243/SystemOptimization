# SystemOptimization

In this project , I have used Random Forest and worked on the data with train the model. Initially it was worked with Vanilla Random Forest. 

First it was optimization with scaling the model size.

Later parallel algorithm was used for random forest. Later parallel result was combined. We could not see a major improvment in efficiency due to datasize however on 
big dataset this will give a major gain in the efficiency.
